                    The series revolves around four older, 
                    single women (three widows and one 
                    divorcée) sharing a house in Miami,
                    Florida. The owner of the house is a widow
                    named Blanche Devereaux (Rue
                    McClanahan), who was joined by fellow
                    widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and
                    divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
                    They both responded to a room-for-rent
                    ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery
                    store. In the pilot episode, the women had
                    a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin),
                    who was subsequently removed.[5] The
                    three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother,
                    Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the
                    retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.
